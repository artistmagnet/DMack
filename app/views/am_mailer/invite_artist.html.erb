Dear <%= @invitation.first_name %>:
<p>
  I am in the process of completing my professional hyperlinking Resume on <%= link_to "Artist Magnet", root_url %>, the theatre revolution, and I just added a <%= @related_entity.class.name %> page for <%= @related_entity.name %>, and remembered that you were involved in <%= @related_entity.class.name == 'Production' ? 'that production as well' : 'a production there' %>.
</p>
<p>
  Will you consider joining <%= link_to "Artist Magnet", root_url %> and building your own professional hyperlinking Resume, then <%= @related_entity.class.name == 'Production' ? 'linking our Production Page so we can be linked together?' : 'adding that Production?' %> It's very easy, fun and thereâ€™s no cost to you.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for your help, and see you soon on <%= link_to "Artist Magnet", root_url %>,
</p>
