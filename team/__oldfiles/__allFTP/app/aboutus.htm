				About Artist Magnet:<br>
				<br> Artist Magnet is the theatre revolution, connecting
				artists through productions and venues everywhere. The concept was
				developed out of a desire to see the theatre world enter the 21st
				century, where instead of Artists lugging around piles of paper
				resumes stapled to headshots, mailing and handing them out to
				hundreds of casting directors, managers, agents and producers to be
				put in a filing cabinet and in many cases never to be seen again
				Artists could simply mention their name and Artist Magnet, and
				anyone could go online and not only instantly find, print and share
				the Artists updated professional resumes, but also click on any
				past, present or upcoming productions they were involved with,
				venues they worked in or Directors they worked with, and be
				instantly forwarded to that show or venue page, displaying links to
				the resumes of every Artist that worked on that production, links to
				the pages of every show performed in that venue, and links to the
				resumes of every Director they worked with. We are only at the very
				first step and there is a long way to go with Artist Magnets
				network-in-development, but it is important that the hyperlinking
				resumes remain FREE for all Artists; production companies, agents,
				casting directors and producers will pay to get access to the
				Artists resumes, instead of the standard practice of Artists paying
				for the privilege of putting their resumes on producers websites.
				And theatre resumes are only the beginning; ultimately we will
				expand our services to every field of Artistry everywhere in the
				world. We hope you join us in this journey by contributing to the
				development of this site at <a

				you soon on Artist Magnet! <br>
